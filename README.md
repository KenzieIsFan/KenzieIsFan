## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi my name is Kenzie Isfandiar and I am a graduate of the University of Southampton with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
If you are looking for my profile, I hope that I can provide good examples of what I can do with coding and my knowledge of CS.

ðŸŒ´ I am currently improving my front-end skills after seeing that while I have a solid knowledge in backend development, my front end skills for websites are still lacking.
I am also interested in learning Lynx, the mobile development framework by ByteDance, as it may become a popular framework in the future after seeing the success of TikTok globally.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a website to help supplement information regarding the Tekken World Tour since it is a tour of events that I enjoy watching.
I hope that the website can bring some interesting insights to how player rankings may change in a game with multiple patches over a year.
I have also developed a small extension to help avoid getting distracted by short form media. It is currently for Youtube, but really should be on mobile devices, since that's where productivity is lost.
